Each role identified in the C2 System and described in Section~\ref{sec:roles}, is modeled as a Program Graph(PG) and has their main steps of execution mapped with their variables and constraints.

The actions executing data exchange, i.e., with the '!' and '?' marquees, will be explained in the Section~\ref{sec:cs}. The guard conditions and effects caused by the actions or functions over the variables are described bellow each PG.
