The C2 System proposed by this work is composed by three roles listed in Table \ref{table:table04}, that can be performed by one or more elements and in concurrent way, i.e., a member or individual can perform more than one role simultaneously.

According to this roles division, we have two different perspectives. The first one is based on the roles themselves, where in case of C2A and TA present their execution scattered among different individuals, characterizing a crosscutting concern. The second one is based on the the member, who gets the features and code of the roles linked to it. This last perspective can be solved by features superimposition.

The superimposition is an well known technique to combine features and merge their code generating a customized software\cite{apel100}. This technique can be applied during the agents configuration and also in the role's implementation, conferring mechanism to support variability. Based on this, the final result aiming by the roles TA and C2A is only obtained after the execution of all members that play these roles.

Initially, the C2 System needs, at least, one element with the task allocator (TA) role. The C2 Approach selector role (C2A), by premise, is executed by a single element that can even be an external coordinator of the team, i.e., a central command. However, the TA role executed by many elements, does not perform the function completely. The task allocation will be the final result of all TA actions. On the other hand, the executor role (EX) works completely within the element executing all its function. Based on this, we do not have a crosscutting concern and scattered feature. 

\cite{apel100} shows the superimposition as a technique used to merge roles, attempting to restrictions related to the order of roles appearance or execution. It can be applied to combine different roles being played by the same element, e.g., task allocation and C2 approach selector. This kind of combination supports variability and treats a concern crosscutting resulted from the scattered roles\cite{apel2011, marin2005}.
