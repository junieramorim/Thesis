	Edge C2 & All elements are connected to everyone; There are $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ connections & Fully connected & Fully Connected \\[5ex]
	Collaborative C2 & Shared resources; entities interdependence; suitable to holistic problems that can not be fully decomposed; peer-to-peer communication & Scale-free Networks (a few nodes have a very large number of connections) & Star + Fully connected \\[5ex]
	Coordinated C2 & Suitable to problems that can be fully decomposed; share necessary information to execute what was defined & Random Networks (same probability to connect) & Star \\[5ex]
	De-Conflicted C2 & The situation can be decomposed with no cross impact; sub-optimized; not suitable to dynamic scenarios & Small World Networks ( $\log{N}$ connections & Ring \\[5ex]
	Conflicted C2 & No communication between entities & Isolated & - \\[1ex]
